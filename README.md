<h1>My page</h1>
<p>My text, text, text. I am writeing text. Do I want to? No I don't. It's 2 in the morning and everyone is sleeping.</p>
<p>Why am I even doing this? I don't want fame money or a family. I need this to make money and survive. Survive for what?</p>
<p>Do I really need to survive? What for? I have no goals, nothing makes me happy, life only gets harder by the week.</p>
<p>Now this too... Why? Why is it so wrong if you just don't want to exist anymore? I don't want to go to a better place,</p>
<p>I just want to not exist at all. I've had a few good years and I'm happy with them. If life went on forever would others</p>
<p> feel the same? Depends. I sure wouldn't want to be alive forever given the opportunity. Why is that we should all try to</p>
<p>make it to our 80s. What is so special about getting old? The world won't change weather I'm here or not. I sure don't</p>
<p>want to stick around and neighter am i forcing others to. Life should be optional and not demanded so there will be</p>
<p>more work force. I must make my own decisions and not stay around against my will. But I will make this page despite</p>
<p>how late it is. God knows that there will be much more tomorrow</p>
